    <p><strong><h1>Vehicle</h1></strong></p>
    <p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup><span style="color:blue">[1]</span></sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. 
        Vehicles include wagons,<br> bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), 
        railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships,<br> boats), amphibious vehicles 
        (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and<br> spacecraft.<sup><span style="color:blue">[2]</span></sup>

<p>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive 
forces against the ground:<br> wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 
is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for<br> road vehicles types,
